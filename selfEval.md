# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I am adding to my confidence in this area. The simple comparison operators are easier to write.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I need to add to my confidence with the logical operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I feel confident with the if statements, now that I have written a few examples and pushed to GitHub
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent two hours on this topic, but got held up with confusing myself on the git clone command for the remote repo.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice all of the conditional statements more and am going to take time over the next three weeks to become more familiar with these, before Mod 1 begins.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I'm curious if practicing the if/else statements will become second nature, or if they are always challenging to think through and write.
